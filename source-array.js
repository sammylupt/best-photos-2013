"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;THOMAS PETER&lt;/b&gt;, Germany &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “It was a sunny and calm Monday afternoon when I flew in a German army transport helicopter above a flooded region north of Magdeburg, the capital of the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. The Elbe river had swollen to over seven meters above its normal levels and broken its banks and a dyke near the village of Fischbeck. Farmlands, forests and whole villages were inundated by its waters. Hundreds of people had to flee their homes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Strapped to a bucket seat I sat beside the helicopter’s open sliding door and surveyed the water landscape below me: sunken buildings, tree tops and the tops of abandoned cars dotted the glistening, caramel-colored surface of the deluge. Here and there a street or a pristinely groomed hedge rose above the water as a reminder of the human order that had been submerged by the force of nature. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; One week earlier I had waded through flooded villages upstream. Up to my waist in water I photographed the efforts of rescue teams and volunteers trying to contain the rising river and evacuate trapped inhabitants. When covering a natural disaster of this kind you have to be in the middle of it to capture the emotional dimension of the tragedy. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Yet a bird’s-eye view is equally as important. For only from above can you show the extent of a flood. Or as in the case of this picture, by picking certain graphic details, you can bring the absurdity of the situation to the viewer’s attention. When the world in which we are ensconced so happily with all our man-made facilities becomes submerged by dirty water, everything assumes an unreal quality. When people’s homes turn into forlorn boxes surrounded by a freak lake that stretches to the horizon, you understand that the order we take for granted is a mere illusion in the face of nature’s caprices. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; At some point the helicopter made a right turn, dipping the side I was sitting on deep below the horizon. And there it was right below me, the epitome of the absurd flood picture: the baby-blue oval of a swimming pool evenly surrounded by muddy water. I trained my 300mm lens straight down and composed as well as I could, which was a challenge in the soaring air stream that nearly snatched my camera out of my hands. I fired off some 10 frames before the chopper leveled out. The picture was gone. No one else on board had seen it.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 1D Mark X, lens 300mm, f7.1, 1/2000, ISO 500 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A garden with a swimming pool is inundated by the waters of the Elbe river during floods near Magdeburg in the federal state of Saxony Anhalt, June 10, 2013.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2013/06/16/poolside-floods/&quot;&gt;Click here for a related blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;Es war ein sonniger, windstiller Montag als ich an Bord eines Bundeswehr-Hubschraubers über das Flutgebiet im Raum Magdeburg flog. Das Wasser der Elbe stand sieben Meter über dem Normalpegel und hatte einen Damm in der Nähe des Dorfes Fischbeck durchbrochen. Felder, Wälder und ganze Dörfer wurden überflutet. Hunderte von Menschen mussten evakuiert werden. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Ich sass angeschnallt an der offenen Schiebetür des Hubschraubers und liess mein Auge über die Wasserlandschaft gleiten, welche sich unter mir bis an den Horizont erstreckte. Ich sah untergegangene Häuser, Baumkronen und Autodächer waren verstreut über die glatte, karamelfarbene Wasseroberfläche. Manchmal ragte eine Strasse oder Ensemble von Hecken aus der Flut hervor, Zeugnisse der versunkenen menschlichen Ordnung.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Eine Woche zuvor watete ich durch überflutete Dörfer flussaufwärts von hier. Ich steckte sprichwörtlich mittendrin. Bis zur Gürtellinie im Wasser stehend dokumentierte ich wie Rettungsteams und ganze Armeen von Freiwilligen versuchten die Schäden der Flut zu begrenzen.     &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Jetzt sah ich aus der Vogelperspektive das wahre Ausmass der Flut. Einmal, als der Hubschrauber während seines einstündigen Fluges eine scharfe Rechtskurve flog und die Seite auf der ich sass sich tief gen Erde neigte, hatte ich es plötzlich vor mir: den Inbegriff des absurde Flutbildes. Ein babyblauer Swimmingpool umgeben von matschig-braunem Wasser. Ich richtete mein Teleobjektiv gerade nach unten und versuchte im starken Fahrtwind, der mir fast die Kamera aus der Hand riss, das Bild so gut wie möglich aufzufassen. Ich feuerte etwa 10 Bilder und dann, keine 3 Sekunden später, war er weg. Keiner an Bord ausser mir hat den Pool gesehen.” "}

It’s at this juncture that my colleague, Thomas Mukoya, called to advise me of another alert from the Westgate Shopping Mall and he was rushing to the scene to check. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Minutes later he called to tell me it was bad and he was with Goran Tomasevic at the scene. I immediately picked up a safety vest for both of us, two helmets and a gas mask. On arrival at the shopping mall I met Goran, our regional chief photographer, taking cover at the front entrance of Westgate. I handed him the extra helmet and the gas mask and made my way to the back entrance. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; What met my eyes was shocking. Experience was a guiding principle as I set my eyes on the woman writhing on the floor. With all the confusion surrounding us, I knelt down to assure her help was close by as I took several images at the same time.This particular image summarized for me the horror of the breaking news event and was the first image I transmitted.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 5D Mark III, lens 24-70mm, f3.5, 1/250, ISO 400  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: An injured woman cries for help after gunmen stormed the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi September 21, 2013.

But with a momentary glance, all that changed.  His gaze straight at me was piercing and haunting, tearing through my camera lens and into my mind's eye, burrowing itself deeper into the innermost recesses of my psyche. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I tracked him down, met and interviewed him about a month later at a detention center.  Seventeen-year-old Mohammed Ilmi Adam, from Mogadishu, fled Somalia to try to find his parents who he believes escaped to Europe when he was just a child.  He had no recollection of seeing me shooting his picture when he arrived here - but he was glad I did. &quot;Maybe my parents or someone who knows them will see me and recognize me,&quot; he said. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Though I often photograph arriving would-be immigrants, it's very rare that I'm able to speak to them afterwards and gauge their reaction to beingphotographed.

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;CARLOS BARRIA&lt;/b&gt;, China &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “As part of a long project on love in China I came across a mass wedding event being held in a shopping mall. The idea behind my photo project was to explore what it's like being young in China and dealing with intense social pressure to get married. It's not just parents who are impatient for their children to marry. Even local governments sometimes get into the act. This event was organized by the Shanghai government to promote the institution of marriage. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In China, there are several factors that prompt people to take this issue so seriously. The one-child policy, combined with an increasingly modern lifestyle, has brought birthrates down while China's elderly population grows. Analysts say China will need a big work force to support its seniors. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I went to this event looking for an image which would explain to me why so many Chinese say they're having a hard time finding the right partner. One of the things that had grabbed my attention was the way that many young people seemed to have a hard time interacting with one another. At the same time, they'd been exposed to a romantic ideal of love that may have seemed frivolous to older generations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Walking about the shopping mall, I saw a couple waiting for a mass wedding to begin. They were sitting together in a display area for living room furniture. I spent some time watching them, waiting for them to interact. After five minutes I understood that the picture that I was looking for was already there, in front of me.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 5D Mark III, lens 50mm, f1.2, 1/1000, ISO 2000 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A couple waits to participate in a staged mass wedding, organized as part of a matchmaking event to inspire singles to get married, in a suburban area of Shanghai May 18, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “在拍摄“爱在中国”特辑的时候，有一次，我遇到了一个在商场里举办的集体婚礼。我希望能够透过我拍摄的照片表现出中国的年轻人在婚姻方面受到的社会压力。除了父母对孩子早日结婚的期待之外，甚至连当地政府也有时会做出努力。这场集体婚礼就是上海市政府为了宣传婚姻机构而组织的。&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; 在中国，有很多因素促使人们非常严肃地对待感情问题。计划生育政策，以及越来越现代化的生活方式，拖低了出生率。然而，老年人口却持续地在增长。&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; 去集体婚礼的时候，我一直在寻找答案：为什么那么多中国人都在艰难的寻找他们的另一半。引起我注意的是，许多年轻人不太会和别人相处。他们一直沉浸在理想化的浪漫主义爱情思想中。 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; 在那个商场中闲逛，我看到一对情侣齐坐在卧室家具的展厅中，等待婚礼开始。我在旁观察了一段时间，看他们如何相处。过了五分钟以后，我才明白，其实我要等的所谓“互动”就是我眼前的那样。”  "}

He told us about the body of a woman who was found dead with shots in her back and head. She was wearing a yellow blouse and she looked like she had been coming from a party. A car was parked near her body but it looked abandoned. She received two shots to her head and one in the back and it looked like she had been begging for her life. I found the reaction of the other journalists astounding; they seemed to have lost all sensitivity and gathered around the body. After a while I got closer as well. Minutes later we received another call letting us know of another crime scene.We left the scene of the dead woman, only a police officer stayed behind in the total darkness waiting for the forensic technicians.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon Mark IV, lens 50mm, f2.8, 1/230, ISO 800 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: The dead body of a woman who was killed with three gunshots is seen at a crime scene in San Pedro Sula March 21, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2013/04/05/life-and-death-in-the-murder-capital/&quot;&gt;Click here for a related blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Eran la una de la madrugada y estábamos dando vueltas por la ciudad de San Pedro Sula cuando recibimos una llamada diciéndonos de que habían encontrado el cuerpo de una mujer, con tiros en la espalda y la cabeza. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Ella llevaba una blusa amarilla y parecía haber salido de una fiesta. Un carro estaba parqueado cerca pero se veía como que no funcionaba.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Ella recibió dos disparos en la cabeza y uno en la espalda, por la posición en que se encontraba parecía haber estado pidiendo a sus asesinos por su vida.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Me parecía sorprendente la perdida de sensibilidad de parte de los colegas periodistas cuando rodearon el cuerpo, después de un rato me acerque también. Minutos después recibimos mas llamados de muertes violentas y salimos hacia el siguiente lugar, dejando a un solo oficial a espera del forense en medio de una oscuridad absoluta.”"}

His neighborhood has a reputation for being contentious, so many organizations wanted to provide it with a face-lift. This is why they contacted several graffiti artists to work in the neighborhood. I was strolling through the neighborhood when I turned a street and suddenly found Tavares, who was working on his fantastic graffiti of Nelson Mandela. Tavares’ neighborhood is mostly populated by Cape Verdean and Angolans, so Tavares’ graffiti was like a tribute to the origins of the neighborhood’s residents. All the residents were happy with having Nelson Mandela smiling in their neighborhood. While Tavares was putting the final touches to his work, curious people were looking at his piece and I went to them in order to ask them about their opinion about Tavares’ work. A gentleman of Angolan origin told me that Tavares 's work was like &quot;a ray of light in a dark  neighborhood&quot;. This comment made me think a lot about the role we play in our difficult environment. There are people who have the gift of giving light to difficult environments, such as the case of Mandela in South Africa, and also why not, Nelson Tavares in his neighborhood.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 1DX, lens 16-35mm, f2.8, 1/1600, ISO 200 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Nelson Tavares, 24, originally from Cape Verde, works on a graffiti of Nelson Mandela which he painted during festivities in his neighborhood in Lisbon June 20, 2013.

O seu bairro tem a reputação de ser algo conflituoso e, por isso, várias organizações queriam melhorar a sua imagem e contactaram vários grafiteiros para fazer diversas obras. Eu estava a passear pelo bairro quando, ao virar uma rua, encontrei de repente o Tavares trabalhando no seu fantástico graffiti de Nelson Mandela. O bairro do Tavares é maioritariamente habitado por pessoas originárias de Cabo Verde e Angola, de modo que o graffiti de Tavares é como que um tributo à origem dos vizinhos. Todos os vizinhos ficaram felizes tendo um Nelson Mandela sorridente no seu bairro. Enquanto Tavares estava a dar os toques finais ao seu trabalho, não faltavam curiosos a ver como trabalhava. Fui ter com eles para saber o que achavam da obra do Tavares. Um senhor de origem Angolana disse-me que o trabalho dele era como &quot;um raio de luz num bairro escuro&quot;. Este comentário fez-me pensar muito sobre o papel que as pessoas desempenham no nosso ambiente. Em que há pessoas que têm o dom de trazer luz para ambientes difíceis, como é o caso de Mandela na África do Sul, e também porque não, do Nelson Tavares no seu bairro.”"}

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;JOHN KOLESIDIS&lt;/b&gt;, Greece &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;That morning I woke up to the deafening sound of thunder. The rain was pouring hard. I watched the rain out the window flood the surrounding streets and wondered how I could get to the office without getting soaked. After a few minutes I looked out the window again, and things had taken a dramatic turn. A bit further down the street I could see an immobilized car getting swollen by the flood. I took my cameras, and tried to get there. I walked through a small park, but that led me behind barbed wire which I couldn't get over. I saw a woman trying to hold on to her car door, while the water was at waist level. The woman's leg was trapped among the branches that were being washed away under her car door, and she could easily get swept away too. She was panicky, and the look on her face was crying for help. Then a man on the same side of the street climbed on top of her car and tried to help her. I took this picture behind the barbed wire, and then I tried to find a way to to get closer. When I got in front of the fence, it was impossible to get closer to her because there was a cascade between me and the woman, as she was on the other side of the road. During the whole thing the thought that the flood could wash her away made my blood freeze and I felt extremely uncomfortable as I captured this scene.&quot; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 5D Mark III, lens 24mm, f3.2, 1/80, ISO 800 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A woman is rescued from flood waters by a resident standing on top of her car during heavy rain in Chalandri suburb north of Athens February 22, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;Εκείνο το πρωί ξύπνησα από τον εκκωφαντικό θόρυβο των αστραπών. Έξω γινόταν χαλασμός και έβρεχε καταρακτωδώς. Παρακολουθούσα τη βροχή από το παράθυρό μου να πλημμυρίζει τους γύρω δρόμους και σκεφτόμουν πως θα κατάφερνα να πάω στο γραφείο χωρίς να βραχώ. Μετά από λίγα λεπτά ξανακοίταξα από το παράθυρο και η κατάσταση είχε αλλάξει δραματικά. Δυο δρόμους μακρύτερα έβλεπα ένα σταματημένο αυτοκίνητο να το καταπίνουν τα νερά της βροχής. Πήρα τις φωτογραφικές μου μηχανές και προσπάθησα να φτάσω στο σημείο. Προχώρησα μέσα από το πάρκο που μεσολαβούσε, αλλά αυτό με οδήγησε πίσω από ένα συρματόπλεγμα από όπου δεν μπορούσα να πλησιασω. Είδα μια γυναίκα να πασχίζει να κρατηθεί από τη πόρτα του αυτοκινήτου της ενώ τα νερά περνούσαν τη μέση της. Το πόδι της είχε πιαστεί από τα παρασυρόμενα κλαδιά κάτω από τη πόρτα και το νερό ήταν εύκολο να την παρασύρει. Ήταν πανικοβλημένη και το ύφος της ικέτευε για βοήθεια. Αμέσως μετά ένας άντρας από τη δική της μεριά σκαρφάλωσε στο αυτοκίνητό της προσπαθώντας να την βοηθήσει. Τράβηξα αυτή τη φωτογραφία πίσω από το συρματόπλεγμα και αμέσως μετά έψαξα τρόπο για να μπορέσω να πλησιάσω. Όταν βρέθηκα μπροστά από το συρματόπλεγμα ήταν αδύνατον να φτάσω κοντά της, μας χώριζε ένα ορμητικό ποταμι. Σε όλη τη διάρκεια της διάσωσή της η σκέψη ότι το ρεύμα μπορούσε να την παρασύρει έκανε το αίμα μου να παγώνει και αισθανόμουν απίστευτα άβολα καθώς κατέγραφα τη σκηνή.”"}

It was crowded and with all of the media and all of the visiting dignitaries I had to tilt the camera to crop out a giant pile of cameramen. This one worker holding the spire steady as it was raised off the ground was probably the most interesting thing that happened this day because after that the spire was just pulled straight up by a crane with no more human interaction.

Given that very few photographs were focusing on the humanitarian affairs, and the daily struggle of the Syrians. The main focus of the news agencies was given to the fighters on the frontline.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Once I joined Reuters, I had to move to Beirut from where I traveled to Turkey in order to enter Aleppo. I took this photo some ten days after I arrived in Aleppo.

I thought that a missile had targeted our building, and I rapidly ran to the scene which was approximately ten yards away from my place. Fire and destruction was all over, chaos and fear were at the highest level. People were expecting more artillery to target the scene. However, I started to take photos, and suddenly this man appeared while weeping hysterically and ripping his clothes. His friends were trying to calm him down. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  I learned that the missile hit his house while he was away.

Suddenly, I got a call from my office and I had to move to Savar, and the Rana Plaza building site immediately. The way to Savar from Dhaka was silent, dark and full of fear.  I found an ambulance heading to the site. I started to follow it on my bike.  The nearer I got to the site the whole environment was full of the smell of dead bodies. I started taking pictures as soon as I reached the area. After that I took a break and sat on a pile of bricks. The rescue workers were tirelessly pulling up bodies from the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The sun was rising. The rescue operation continued. Suddenly a rescue worker shouted, “A body is under the rubble.” I attempted to get closer but a member of the army stopped me because of security reasons. I kept waiting and came back to the same place after a while, looking for an opportunity.  The security personnel had changed over the last few hours.  I continued to wait there to take a photograph.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; There were some other photographers arriving from Dhaka. It was 11 am. Suddenly, rescue workers found a different body, and the photographers began taking pictures.  I stayed back and slowly moved toward the body. I saw the hand of a garment worker through the rubble. It seemed like the person was struggling hard to live. I started taking pictures of the hand amid a strong dead body smell. But the security force returned and stopped me.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The whole thing reverberated in my mind on my way back to Dhaka. I was thinking how soon the other survivors would be rescued. I couldn’t remove it from my thoughts - not ever, as the tragedy of Rana Plaza cannot be erased from our minds.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 1D MKIV, lens 28-105mm, f10, 1/400, ISO 1600 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: The hand of a garment worker is seen among the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Savar, 30 km (19 miles) outside Dhaka April 30, 2013.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;"}

Every year around the eighteenth day of the eighth month in the Chinese Lunar Calendar, the tidal waves reach their peak level, attracting tens of thousands of tourists to witness the event. It was my first time covering the tidal waves. Before my assignment, I knew there were many nice images from there. Most of them were of people running away from the surging tides. It gets tiring seeing so many similar images. Therefore, I was determined to shoot something different.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The first day, because of the lack of experience, I was knocked to the ground by a huge wave. My cell phone, bag, wallet were all soaked, and my shoes were also washed away. On the second day, which happened to be the eighteenth day of the eighth month, I believed the waves would be much stronger especially with Typhoon Usagi approaching China at the same time. After learning a great deal from the embarrassing previous day, I reached the observation area earlier. I decided not to get too close but to be behind the tourists. I thought that the bigger waves and the bigger crowd might be able to fit in one frame. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Then it was all about luck, I was lucky that the tide hit and surged right in front of my camera, and also lucky enough that all the people all raised their mobile phones or camera trying to take pictures. Many may wonder why these tourists didn’t run from the waves. Actually, the police had closed the river bank to tourists because of possible risks, so I can assure everyone these people were safe, and every one of them probably had pretty good pictures.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS-1D Mark IV, lens 16-35mm, f9, 1/1000, ISO 400 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Visitors take pictures of tidal waves under the influence of Typhoon Usagi in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, September 22, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; 钱塘江是中国浙江省最大的河流，其入海口呈喇叭状，每逢涨潮海水倒灌，水势受阻，便形成著名的奇观“钱塘潮”，与印度恒河潮、亚马孙潮，并称“世界三大涌潮”。每年农历八月十八，钱塘江涌潮最大，潮头可达数米，潮来时的推力，能把数吨重的巨石推至十多米高。自古以来，观潮就是当地民间的一项传统习俗，现在甚至已成为一项旅游产业，每年吸引了海内外数十万的游客赶来观潮。    而关于钱江潮的精彩照片也会经常出现，大多都是潮起人逃的狼狈景象，看多了也难免有点视觉疲劳。就在拍摄这幅照片的前一天，第一次拍潮的我，因为靠得太近，拍完照片后，自己也被潮水扑倒在地，手机、摄影包、钱包等全部被泡湿，鞋子也被冲走了。    经历了狼狈的“第一次”后，第二天，9月22日，是农历的八月十八日，也是观赏钱塘江大潮的最佳时间。加上恰巧受到台风“天兔”外围影响，我断定，当天的潮水一定更加壮观。    离大潮奔腾而来还有很长时间，我赶到了杭州七格观潮点，那里已经聚集了无数观潮者，大家手里拿着相机或手机，焦急而又兴奋地等待着潮水的到来。为了安全起见，警察特地把危险地段的江堤封锁起来，禁止任何人进入。所有人都在安全范围内等待，确保潮水冲上岸时不会被打到。"}

I showed my camera, she nodded her head, yes so I came in to take pictures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The 30-year-old is a stateless Muslim Rohingya displaced by violence between Buddhists and Muslims and is spending her time with thousands of others in a strip of basic camps just outside Sittwe, in Myanmar’s Rakhine states.

I asked a few questions through my assistant and she told me it was her ninth month and the baby could come out at any time. Roma’s husband was out looking for something to eat – they had no money for food or to pay a doctor. She would deliver her baby here, on the concrete floor of an abandoned rubber factory. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I left the shelter to find my colleagues from the Reuters team traveling with me and when we came back the woman was rolling around on the floor breathing heavily and moaning, obviously in great pain.

Covering it as a Reuters photographer was one of the most demanding and frustrating assignments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; We were given strict orders by the court not to take photographs of anything or anyone while the magistrate was in the courtroom. This limited our access to Oscar and made it difficult to take good pictures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; On his first court appearance he stood in the dock and looked straight at the magistrate, avoiding looking at photographers and the people in the gallery. The magistrate read out that Oscar had been charged with murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Oscar bowed his head and breathed heavily, struggling to contain his emotions and wept. I think this was when it hit him that it was not a dream but reality. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; On the second day we were allowed in the court during proceedings, but again we weren’t allowed to take any photographs. I sat in front of the dock, an arm’s length from Oscar. Because of the poor light in the courtroom I positioned myself in such a way that should I get a chance to photograph him I would make use of the available light.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I positioned myself to have him in the center and also get the people in the background to illustrate the atmosphere of the courtroom. It did not take long: the magistrate called for a short break and as he left the court I stood up as quickly as I could and took a few frames of Oscar standing and facing the direction of the magistrate. I then gave my camera card to a TV colleague to pass it on to my manager who was outside the court waiting to file the images.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  Canon EOS-1D Mark IV, lens 16-35mm at 18mm, f2.8, 1/200, ISO 1250 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: &quot;Blade Runner&quot; Oscar Pistorius awaits the start of court proceedings in the Pretoria Magistrates court February 19, 2013.

Maybe it was too simple, just a description. I normally don’t go to fast-food places, it’s against my personal and very particular habits, even if it can sometimes be the only option because if there’s nothing else, there will always be an open fast-food joint.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;   It was in one of the branches of the “Pollo Campero” in the heart of downtown Guatemala City where I took the picture. I did it without looking for it, if I’d looked for it, I would have never found it. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; It was a sunny day; I was looking for some pictures with that beautiful light and the blue sky that happens occasionally in the city. I grabbed a cab and went downtown when I suddenly heard the striking sound of an ambulance’s siren which sped past, almost driving on the sidewalk. When the ambulance stopped two paramedics jumped out and went into a fast-food restaurant. My cab was stuck in traffic so I got out of the car, ran and entered the fast food restaurant before the guards could close the door. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Inside, the situation was relaxed, one of the paramedics turned out to be an old acquaintance and a friend. He always calls me when there is something interesting. He works as a paramedic and firefighter and the firefighters in Guatemala are the first ones to be everywhere. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; My friend mentioned that a person had fainted but everything was under control. While he was talking to me I looked over his shoulder and saw two nuns sitting underneath photographs showing a hamburger and a fried chicken leg. I asked my friend the firefighter and paramedic “Do you see this beautiful picture?” and I took two steps forward and took the shot.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; One of the nuns had already noticed and tilted her head slightly as she was somewhat disapproving of what I was doing.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I left with the paramedics, we said goodbye and I thanked them once more. I had taken a great picture and I was as excited as a child. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The simple and unexpected things sometimes taste better than anything else; it’s also a fact that every photograph will always have its special story, regardless of a simple caption.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 5D Mark III, lens 16-35mm, f2.8, 1/100, ISO 400 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Nuns sit at a fast food restaurant downtown of Guatemala City August 28, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Este es el caption con el cual envié la foto, demasiado simple creo, solo descriptivo.

La hice sin buscarla, que evidentemente si buscaba nunca iba a aparecer.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Era un día soleado, buscaba hacer un par de fotos con esa bonita luz y cielo azul que en ocasiones hay en la ciudad. Pase a bordo de un taxi por la calle donde está la oficina de correos cuando todo se ve interrumpido por los sonoros y llamativos ruidos de la sirena de una ambulancia, que rápidamente pasa casi subida sobre la banqueta. , Cuando para bajan velozmente 2 paramédicos, ya no podía pasar en el taxi así que corrí una cuadra hasta llegar al fast-food y entre, el guardia yo no tuvo tiempo para impedirme la entrada.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  Adentro la situación ya era relajada, uno de los paramédicos resulto ser un viejo conocido y amigo. Siempre me avisa cuando hay algo fuerte porque trabaja como paramédico y bombero y en Guatemala los bomberos son los primeros en llegar a todo. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Mi amigo me comento que una persona se había desmayado pero que ya estaba bien y mientras lo dice miro por encima de sus hombros y veo a dos monjas sentadas como esperando bajo unos fotografías con una hamburguesa y una pierna de pollo frito, le pregunte a mi amigo el bombero “Ya viste que bonita imagen?” y avanze dos pasos e hice la foto.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Una de las monjas ya esta al tanto e inclina un poco la cabeza como desaprobando lo que estoy haciendo.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Salí junto a los paramédicos, nos despedimos y una vez más les di las gracias. Había logrado una buena foto y me fui, tan entusiasmado como si fuera un niño. Las cosas simples e inesperadas a veces saben mejor de lo que cualquiera pudiese entender, también es un hecho que cada foto tendrá siempre una historia más especial, sin importar lo simple que pueda ser el caption.”"}

Yo podía escuchar al chico gritando a la policía, pero yo no lo podía ver, así que era me paré lo más alto posible en las puntas de los dedos de mis pies, y levanté mi cámara para fotografiarlos cuando la policía trató de separarlos. Pude ver a un policía presionando los dedos en la garganta del chico, pero él resistió y estaba decidido a no ser separado de su compañera, a pesar de la nube de gas lacrimógeno que los cubría. Como un cambio de táctica, el policía soltó la garganta del estudiante y forzó su brazo entre los dos manifestantes, justo a la altura de la boca del chico. Fue entonces cuando el muchacho se defendió mordiendo el brazo del policía, protegido con armadura. El policía presionó la cabeza del chico contra su armadura, y la sangre empezó a fluir de su boca antes de que la pareja fue llevada detenida. Todavía mantenían el abrazo.”"}

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;STEVE NESIUS&lt;/b&gt;, United States &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “After covering several MLB spring training games crammed into ridiculously tight photo wells with other still photographers, TV crews and team interns shooting videos of pitchers and batters, it was nice to be assigned to a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees at McKechnie Field in Bradenton, Florida. Most photographers choose to shoot on the walkway behind the seats with cleaner fields of view. I wanted to start the game in the third base well, which is low to ground level, during the first inning to get both starting pitchers before heading up to shoot from the walkway. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; It turned out to be a good decision. The Yankees batted first. Lead-off batter Eduardo Nunez singled, then stole second base. Brennan Boesch, in his second game since joining the Yankees after his release by the Tigers, was batting second. Boesch broke his bat on an infield single. Nunez advanced to third and scored on a throwing error. Kevin Youkilis batted third and hit a two-run homer, scoring Boesch. Yankees were up 3-0. Good action to start the game. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I felt I had some decent frames of Boesch but couldn’t see the back of my camera very well to “chimp” (edit images in camera) in the bright sunshine. It wasn’t until later in the game, as I was editing, I could see I made some good images. In particular, the frame of the barrel of the broken bat smacking the face of Boesch. In a six-frame sequence, Boesch’s bat cracks as he struck the ball. On the follow-through of the swing, the bat broke in two pieces, smacks into his face, knocks his helmet ajar and flies out of the frame as Boesch races to first base with an infield single.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Nikon D3 DSLR, lens 400mm, f4.0, 1/1600, ISO 250 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: The barrel of New York Yankees Brennan Boesch's broken bat smacks his face during the first inning of a MLB spring training baseball game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Bradenton, Florida, March 17, 2013."}

I want to find something unique, and I want to be there first to see it.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I first came up with this idea after finding something online which immediately caught my eye. It was about Pakistani female pilots. There was an article ranking four of them among the country’s 100 most powerful women. A Pakistani female combat pilot! I knew immediately I had to meet her. But it turned out to be tricky. In Pakistan, you need permission to cover pretty much everything. This was no exception. I simply could not find a way of approaching any of the 19 female pilots without getting permission from the military. I kept trying and trying. In the end, when I had almost lost all hope, the army finally approved my request – a good six months later. A spokesman for the Pakistan air force said we were allowed to meet and take pictures of one of the pilots. It turned out to be Ayesha Farooq, the first war-ready female fighter pilot for the nuclear-armed nation. When I saw Farooq with her helmet in hand, walking with her colleagues and chatting with them next to a fighter jet, I would not have known she was a woman - if it were not for her head scarf.  I was happy because I knew I had found a way of showing that a woman can do anything, anything a man can do, and often more, as long as they are not being discouraged or prevented from pursuing their passion. She climbed into the cockpit, her movements precise, and she spoke about her vocation. “Because of things related to terrorism, and due to our geographical location in the area, it’s very important that we should stay on our toes and get prepared for any bad activity going on around,” she said matter-of-factly. I believed Ayesha was a born fighter. She spoke about protecting and defending her country; the same country where women don’t have the same rights as men; the same country where women are often treated as second-class citizens.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS -1D Mark IV, lens 16-35mm, f2.8, 1/60, ISO  400 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Ayesha Farooq, 26, Pakistan's only female war-ready fighter pilot, climbs up to a Chinese-made F-7PG fighter jet at Mushaf base in Sargodha, north Pakistan June 6, 2013.

The presentation was good and time passed between laughter and joy until suddenly one of the trucks shot straight into the public. I was standing on one of the stunt ramps for the trucks and I ran down immediately to see if I could help.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; What I saw was absolutely horrifying: unconscious people lay everywhere, many people seemed to be dead and children were crying and running around. People covered in dust were trying to stand up. I was in shock but I reacted immediately and started to take pictures. It was so difficult but I knew it had to be documented. I took the pictures and then put my camera away and started helping some of the injured, remembering what I had learned about first aid. After a few minutes the first ambulances arrived, I helped the paramedics move the injured, and as the ambulances continued to arrive, I started taking pictures again.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; My heart was full of sorrow, people had been so happy while watching the show and now many of them were crying desperately while cradling their dead children.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Camera Nikon D3100, lens 135 mm, f5.6, 1/2000, ISO 800  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Spectators react after a monster truck rammed the stand where they were watching a monster truck rally show at El Rejon park, on the outskirts of Chihuahua October 5, 2013.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Ese día me encontraba en el espectáculo de la “Monster Truck” la cual se llama aca &quot;Big Show&quot;.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; El tiempo pasaba entre risas y alegría cuando llego el momento de la tragedia y uno de los monster trucks se lanzo sobre el publico presente.

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;PETER ANDREWS&lt;/b&gt;, United States &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “America’s Cup is regarded as one of the most prestigious sporting events in the world. The first cup was awarded in 1851 for the race around the Isle of Wight in England. The race was won by the schooner America. The trophy was renamed Americas Cup after the yacht and was donated to the New York Yacht Club.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; From the first defense of the cup in 1870 there was always one challenger, but in 1970, one hundred years after that race, multiple challengers were introduced. The challengers would run in a selection series and the winner would become the official challenger for the defender of the Americas Cup. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In 1983 Louis Vuitton sponsored the first Louis Vuitton Cup, which has awarded to the winner of the challenge series. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; My picture was taken on the 18th of August just prior to race three of the final of the Louis Vuitton Cup between Team Emirates New Zealand and Italy's Luna Rossa Challenger.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; For me it was a difficult task as eleven days earlier a fellow photographer had lost his balance on the boat during one of the maneuvers and injured my left ankle. The doctors at first said that it was a sprain.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Every day I carried with me three cameras on board: two Canon EOS 1D X that my manager Pawel Kopczynski received on loan from Canon Europe armed with a 500mm f.4 lens and zoom 70-200mm f.2.8. All this was securely placed inside a large waterproof Peli Case. The third camera, in underwater housing, was a Canon EOS 1D Mark II with a 14 mm f 2.8 lens borrowed from Canon at the America’s Cup venue. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Normally, pictures taken with a 500 mm or zoom 70-200 mm lenses are beautiful but quite standard. For that reason I was hoping to be able to capture something different with my underwater gear. It was not easy to do as the AC-72 catamarans were moving very fast at speeds of over 45 knots per hour, translating to almost 80 km/h.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In order to take a picture I had to lean out of the boat and hold my camera by a long monopod, and only when our boat was not chasing the yachts. It was difficult for me as I had to pay attention to my legs too.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I normally set my camera at ISO 500 and a shutter speed of 640, using shutter priority. The conditions on the San Francisco Bay could change from beautiful sunshine to extremely foggy conditions within minutes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The effort paid off and when I got back to shore and looked through my images I found a stunning picture of Team Emirates New Zealand. I asked my good friend Bob Galbraith if he agreed with me. He smiled and said, “You have got a winner.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Three days later Bob took me back to the clinic that initially examined my leg but this time I insisted on an x-ray as my leg was badly swollen and purple up to my knee. The doctors were still saying that my ankle was sprained and saying that if it was going to reassure me they would do an x-ray. I was still in good spirits, joking with doctors and nurses as Bob took hundreds of pictures of me being x-rayed. Then reality hit me. I will not forget the face of the doctor saying, “Your leg is broken.” I believe that my expression was the same or worse. I had been walking and working with a broken leg for two weeks minus five days of rest after the initial exam. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; My Americas Cup was over...” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 1D Mark II, lens 14mm, f2.8, 1/640, ISO 500 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: The Team Emirates New Zealand sails before the third race of their Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series yacht race against Luna Rossa Challenge in this underwater picture in San Francisco, California August 18, 2013.

They were not attacked by either police or protesters but somehow they had to go through the hail of stones and gas. The five people in the photo were running as fast as they could -- the two men in the back waving their tickets to show police they were not protesters and just wanted to cross police lines to reach the stadium.

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;SUSANA VERA&lt;/b&gt;, Spain &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;“My mother grew up watching the San Fermin bull runs from the same balcony on Estafeta Street from which I took the photo of Diego Miralles getting gored by an El Pilar fighting bull named “Langostero”. I have been going to that very same balcony, which happens to be at my uncle’s dental clinic, once every San Fermin festival since 2005, when I first started photographing the running of the bulls in Pamplona. But I had never documented such a terrifying moment in the past. That morning my blood froze in my veins as I witnessed for a whole minute how “Langostero” repeatedly charged at Diego Miralles, goring him three times, in his groin and legs. I never thought 60 seconds could feel so long. I kept on taking photos, trying to stay focused and still, as the drama unfolded in front of my camera. For a while I heard nothing, I’m not sure if my brain just blocked the noise off or people went mute for a few seconds. And then, all of a sudden, I heard screams and the sobbing of a young girl that had come to the balcony with her family to watch the bull run. The tears of a middle-aged woman followed. I didn’t put the camera down until I saw another runner help Diego Miralles get through the fence to receive medical treatment. Miralles could have died that morning. He said in a newspaper interview that he thanks Saint Fermin, the protector of runners, for watching over him. “Langostero”, the bull who could have killed him, was killed himself during the afternoon bullfight. The other five bulls that ran the “encierro” with him that morning met the same fate on the sand of Pamplona’s bullring.&quot; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS-1D X, lens 70-200mm, f5, 1/500, ISO 2000 ISO &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Diego Miralles gets gored by a bull on Estafeta Street during the sixth running of the bulls of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona July 12, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; ”Mi madre creció viendo los encierros de San Fermín desde el mismo balcón en la calle Estafeta desde donde yo fotografié al toro “Langostero” cornear al corredor Diego Miralles el pasado 12 de julio.  Llevaba yendo a ese mismo balcón, que es hoy la consulta dental de mi tío, desde el 2005, cuando comencé a fotografiar los encierros de San Fermín en mi ciudad natal, pero nunca antes había documentado un momento tan terrorífico. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Esa mañana sentí la sangre helarse en mis venas mientras veía a través del visor de mi cámara cómo “Langostero” empitonaba a Diego Miralles, no una vez, sino hasta tres veces, propinándole dos cornadas en la ingle y una en la pierna. Nunca pensé que un minuto pudiera durar tanto.  Intenté mantenerme quieta y concentrada mientras fotografiaba sin parar el drama que se desarrollaba ante mis ojos. Durante un rato no escuché nada. No sé si mi cerebro dio orden de bloquear el ruido o simplemente la gente se quedó muda, pero lo cierto es que durante unos segundo interminables sólo me acompañó el silencio. Y de repente escuché gritos y el llanto de una niña que había acudido con su familia a mi mismo balcón a presenciar el encierro. Las lágrimas de una mujer siguieron. No bajé la cámara ni dejé de apretar el disparador hasta que ví cómo otro corredor ayudaba a Miralles a alcanzar el vallado para recibir asistencia médica.  Diego Miralles podría haber muerto esa mañana del 12 de julio de 2013. Agradeció en una entrevista de un diario local que San Fermín, el protector de los corredores del encierro,  velara por él. “Langostero”, el toro que podría haberlo matado, encontró la muerte a su vez en la corrida de la tarde.  Los otros cinco toros que corrieron el encierro a su lado compartieron el mismo destino en la arena de la plaza de Pamplona.&quot;"}

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;ADREES LATIF&lt;/b&gt;, United States  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “On May 20, 2013, shortly after the EF5 tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, I was en-route to cover a press conference with Yahoo Chief Marissa Mayer. Before the press conference started, I received a message from a colleague: “Are you heading to Oklahoma for the tornado?” While jockeying for a position inside the event, which overlooked New York’s Times Square, I wondered why this seasoned journalist would be inquiring about a tornado which had hit one day prior. (An EF4 tornado had struck Shawnee, Oklahoma on May 19). I ignored the text message and momentarily turned my phone on silent so as not to disturb the attendees. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; About 30 minutes in, the press conference was over and I glanced to look down at my mobile phone. I was a bit surprised to find a half dozen missed calls, all from my line manager. Realizing something important had happened, I called back immediately while racing rapidly through midtown traffic towards the office. As I was made aware of the massive tornado, which had just struck Moore, adrenaline kicked in. I started thinking flights, medical kit, and every possible item I may need to report from the site of such a disaster. Medicated foot powder and extra shoelaces for some reason found themselves at the top of this particular list. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Soon, I would come to realize, Oklahoma City was not the easiest location to fly into from New York. Also, from past experience, the city in close proximity to a disaster starts running low on supplies, so it is sometimes more advantageous to fly into a nearby location and drive the rest of the way. I chose to fly into Tulsa, Oklahoma and picked up an all-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle to help navigate through the ground conditions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I arrived into Moore, Oklahoma midday on May 21. The exits from the highways to the town were closed to all but police and rescue vehicles. After gaining access past a police checkpoint, I drove in and parked on S. Telephone Road near the Warren Theatres. My aim was to get a quick few images published. I then went for a walk and realized police were not allowing anyone to enter the nearby neighborhood, which was completely leveled. Instead of trying to enter from the main street side, which was all blocked by police, I attempted to make my way in between the homes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I soon would come across a scene that mesmerized me. I knew I had found the background of my photograph that would prove the scale of this disaster. As families started returning to their homes to go through their belongings, I introduced myself and asked for permission to photograph on their property. After hours of waiting for ‘a moment’, a couple entered and stood against the background near where I had been patiently waiting. As they entered the space, they too seemed overwhelmed by the site and embraced. The woman in my photograph, who I would later come to identify as Danielle Stephan, had arrived with her boyfriend Thomas Layton to help recover belongings from her brother's home. Knowing I had captured the moment I was waiting for, I immediately pulled out my laptop and transmitted the image to Reuters. Afterwards, I would continue on my way through the destruction zone, searching for other moments which I could photograph to communicate the enormity of what this community in the suburbs of Oklahoma City was struggling through.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EO-1D X, lens 35mm, f2, 1/5000, ISO 50 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Danielle Stephan holds boyfriend Thomas Layton as they pause between salvaging through the remains of a family member's home one day after a tornado devastated the town Moore, Oklahoma, in the outskirts of Oklahoma City May 21, 2013."}

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;TOBY MELVILLE&lt;/b&gt;, England &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Moon, Daddy!” exclaimed my two-year-old daughter excitedly from the rear seat as I drove her back home from a day with the childminder. “Where’s the moon?” I inquired as I concentrated on navigating through the evening rush hour on the busy roads of west London. “Over there: moon!” she repeated.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I knew it was a full and so-called Harvest Moon that night. I had a 500mm lens and decent enough 2 x converter in the trunk of the car as the every-ready back up emergency news set up. But the afternoon had been grotty and drizzly so not for the first time I had pretty much abandoned ideas for ‘full moon’ shots for another month.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; But she was right. As I sat at the traffic lights in an interminable line, I could just catch a glimpse of the huge glowing orb peeping between clouds and houses. So, now the dilemma again of many a photographer when features and news just don’t happen between pre-determined working hours or ‘on-shift’: continue home and then do the cherished fun evening routine of bedtime stories for Junior, followed by wee glass of wine and dinner? Or go moon chasing? &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This time the picture hunt won. Mom was already home, and happy to do the bed routine for our daughter. I promised not to be long (heard that one before!), dropped off Little One, turned the car around, nipped down a couple of well used short cuts, all the while seeing the moon rising higher, darting between clouds and the wonderful dusk blue starting to turn blacker with the moon growing brighter and brighter. The race was on, and opportunities were fading fast! Plane lights flickered as they came into land ever nearer to the moon’s path as I drove away from home, close to Heathrow airport, one of the world’s busiest. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I hadn’t enough time to go to any of the buildings that might work well with the moon rising behind as it was already too high, and I wasn’t close enough to get to the right areas of London. So planes it was.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I raced up and down a road that intersected the landing path of the northern flight landing runway for aircraft coming in from an easterly direction, and then bingo, after about 15 minutes I saw the spot: between two large retail park buildings and just through a gap in the trees that were dotted along the pavement, there shone the moon in the dark sky with incoming planes coming right up through the middle of it. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; DSLR and effectively 1000mm lens over shoulder plus monopod, I raced up and down the busy roadside edge to try and recapture the moment I had just seen out of the car window: the moon was scooting up across the sky darn fast. As I perched my camera and lens on the edge of the pavement, one, then two, then maybe five in total planes came silhouetted through the moon over a 10 minute period or so. Bored, tired drivers briefly looked interested as they wondered what this loon with a huge piece of metal and glass was doing running up and down beside them as they sat in the main road gridlock. Could there really be a celebrity standing on the roof of a Homebase DIY store? &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Another 10 minutes and I was back home. The lights were out upstairs but as I tried to quietly sneak up past my daughter’s bedroom to grab the laptop and edit the frames as quickly as possible, an inquisitive little voice piped up: “See moon, Daddy?” “Yes darling,” I replied. “Night night, it’s sleepy time”. Half an hour of gentle negotiating ensued to get her back to sleep whilst I edited on the stairs landing outside, a glass of red wine helping (or maybe hindering) the editing process. Maybe she’ll be a pilot one day, or an astronaut, or maybe just dream of those things.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Nikon D4, lens 500mm, f16, 1/640, ISO 1600  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A passenger aircraft, with the full &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; seen behind, makes its final approach to landing at Heathrow Airport in west London, September 19, 2013. The Harvest Moon is a traditional name for the full moon that is closest to the autumn equinox, and at a traditional period where farmers would be harvesting crops. The moon's rise time and angle of path give the illusion that the Harvest Moon is both closer, larger and brighter; though actually it is not."}

A quick search on the internet the next day and there was a short video on YouTube that a cyclist had posted as they road their bike past the same spot. That evening a local news channel showed the video and said it was piloted by a man named Otto Dieffenbach. I searched out Otto, found his dad, who had the same name, and then tracked down the designer and pilot. Only problem was he had no interest on showing anyone what he was doing. He said he was out testing a prototype and did not want anyone to see until he was happy with his final design. So we exchanged emails and phone numbers and I would call him every once in a while checking up on how things were going. Sure enough four months or so later, Otto sent me a cryptic email asking to meet him at 7 a.m. on a hill behind a building off a road near an office complex that bordered alongside a canyon. We met up and he introduced me to his new creations as he hauled them out of the back of an old Volvo station wagon.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I shot a bunch of pictures that morning. The fog was just burning off and the light sweet, almost perfect. Otto was test flying his new designs and I was pretty sure I was the first photographer in the world to be photographing a superman RC plane. The test flights were short – only a few minutes. On the last test flight, Otto flew his superman past a Qualcomm office tower and as he banked high to come in for a landing, the moon came in my frame and the picture was made.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon Dx, lens 70-200mm, f5, 1/1000, ISO 100 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A radio-controlled Superman plane, flown by designer Otto Dieffenbach, passes the moon during a test flight in San Diego, California June 27, 2013.

But on the eve of the operation to pull the cruise ship upright I thought an aerial photograph could be the one remaining image that could show the scale of this tragedy. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; It’s still poignant to remember the strong contrast between the 300 yards of the ship’s geometric lines and the jagged coast of Giglio Island. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The most difficult moment arrived when I had to get the permit to fly over the scene. I was told ‘no’ many times but I kept insisting and eventually my persistence opened a door. I found out that the Italian Navy was doing flight training, using the scene of the Costa Concordia as a scenario. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; It was decided that they could bring me close to Giglio Island on a training flight. As I didn’t know how far away we would be from the ship, I had to bring a lot of equipment. I anticipated the open door of the helicopter and the force of the wind could create problems during shooting. But before I started shooting, I was frozen, almost hypnotized by the scene in front of me. It was incredible to see the ship lying on its side. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I started taking as many photos as possible because time was limited. It was summer, and we couldn’t disturb the tourists visiting the island on holidays with the racket of the hovering helicopter. Operating in the climate of Italy’s economic crisis also did not allow much fuel to be wasted. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In the end, I did well to start shooting. Soon afterwards the helicopter turned away, and I could no longer capture the huge length of the boat in one shot. This photo, the best of the set, is the first one I took.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 1X, lens 105mm, f8, 1/1600, ISO 400 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: An aerial view shows the Costa Concordia as it lies on its side next to Giglio Island taken from an Italian navy helicopter August 26, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Migliaia sono stati gli scatti significativi che hanno raccontato la tragedia che  il 13 Gennaio 2012 coinvolse nel naufragio la nave da crociera Concordia. Ma alla vigilia delle operazioni di raddrizzamento dello scafo ho pensato che la foto aerea potesse essere l’ultima immagine che mostrava i segni di questa tragedia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Il forte contrasto tra i trecento metri di linee regolari della nave e le coste frastagliate dell’isola del giglio rimangono una forte emozione. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Ora arrivava la parte difficile quella di trovare le autorizzazioni per poter volare sopra . Molti i “No” incassati ma la forte insistensa mi apri’ una porta importante. Sapevo che la Marina Militare faceva addestramento anche con un simulatore di volo che riproponeva la scena unica del disastro della Concordia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Decisero di portarmi con loro in prossimita del Giglio in un volo di addestramento. Non sapendo a quale distanza ci saremmo trovati dalla nave mi dovetti portare molta attrezzatura sapendo che mi avrebbe creato difficolta’ durante le operazioni di shooting con il portellone aperto dell’elicottero ed i vortici d’aria che mi scuotevano. Prima di scattare rimasi quasi ipnotizzato nell’affacciarmi sulla scena, incredibile vederla su di un fianco. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Mi sbrigai a scattare quanto possibile, era estate e non potevamo disturbare i turisti giunti sull’isola per le vacanze con il fracasso dell’elicottero in overing e anche perche’ la crisi economica non permette piu’ sprechi di carburante. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Questa e’ la foto che ho voluto scattare per prima perche’ cosi’ la immaginavo.&quot;"}

There must have been about 20 members of the media crowding behind a thick 3m by 3m glass panel to film Vujicic's feat, getting their lenses as close as possible to the glass to cut off any reflection. Some stood on a bench shooting over the shoulders of others who were half squatting while latecomers awkwardly did their best to fit in to whatever gap there was on the glass. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; No one knew when Vujicic would dive in so everyone maintained their positions, ready for action. After 20 minutes, most of us were perspiring because it was very stuffy and some even fogged up their patch of the glass panel with their breath.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I was very lucky to have occupied a good spot – dead center – and made many frames of him enjoying his dive. I particularly like this picture of him because it looks quirky – he is hovering in the water looking at sharks that circle him under a ring of light from his enclosure while a diver climbs out on the left of the frame.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 5D Mark II, lens 16-35mm at 16mm, F4 , 1/125, ISO 5000  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Nick Vujicic, an Australian motivational speaker who was born without limbs, swims with sharks at the Marine Life Park in Singapore September 5, 2013.

People, both gay and straight, had gathered there for the announcement all hoping it would be in their favor. When the Court's announcement first came down the bar erupted in celebration, people watched the news coverage and began to enjoy the moment. The local channels broadcast a news conference by one of the defendants in the Supreme Court's case, which was very emotional both on the television and in the bar. I felt I had spent plenty of time in and had made several strong images, but nothing that really stood out for me. I was quite antsy to break away and file. The bar was very dark with only one large window in the front and the lights turned down so people could watch the televisions, this made it very difficult to shoot. As I was walking towards the door I saw a couple who had just arrived standing together watching the coverage, they were becoming quite emotional. I made several frames of them as they watched and reacted to what they were seeing. At that point I was concentrating more on getting the image sharp more than anything else, I had opened up the my lens to 1.6 and was using a very slow shutter setting (1/40th of a sec.) which left very little depth for focus. The light hitting the faces of the two men is actually glow from the television they were watching, and the images were very backlit with the dominant light coming from the window behind them. Just as I had squeezed off several frames, a very large crowd of excited and emotional people arrived to join the celebration. I quickly tried to rush over to the couple to talk with them but as quickly as the light from the television had filled their faces, they disappeared into the growing crowd of joyous celebration. After that I knew it was time to head out and file what I had. I transmitted two images of the couple embracing, but only one had the glow of the television to light them. They clearly stood out in my edit and they will forever stand out in my memory of a highly emotional day that will forever change the way people live and view each other in our society.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 5D Mark III, lens 50mm, f1.4, 1/49, ISO 4000  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Patrons watch coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act at the Stonewall Inn in New York June 26, 2013.

The Femen group, in this case, contacted members of the press the day before the conference organized by the Brussels university ULB on the topic “Blasphemy offense or freedom of expression”.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and Primate of Belgium Andre-Joseph Leonard was due to address the conference and Femen group members planned to protest during his speech. The Roman Catholic Church had been quite often criticized throughout the last year on their position regarding the gay community and the Femen wanted to address that issue during a protest against homophobia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Obviously Archbishop Leonard was not aware of it and was even surprised to see a bunch of photographers waiting for his speech. I had no idea what was about to happen and I didn’t see any suspicious people among the assembly in the atrium. When Leonard started his speech four girls ran from the benches and surrounded the priest. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Spraying water with bottles shaped as the Virgin Mary, the Femen started to shout slogans against homophobia. It took just a few seconds before the activists were kicked out of the room by people attending the conference. Leonard stayed sitting and joined his hands in prayer. He did not react and waited until it was finished. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Some people in the room had very strong reactions against the activists but also against the press photographers. We were accused by some people of complicity with the Femen group. That was absolutely wrong because we were not aware of what was about to take place. Our job was to be there and report.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 1DX, lens 16-35 mm, f5.6, 1/250, ISO 1600 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Activists from women's rights group Femen react after spraying water at Belgian Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and Primate of Belgium Andre-Joseph Leonard (L) during a conference at Brussels University ULB April 23, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Nous réfléchissons toujours deux fois, en tant que photographe travaillant pour une agence de presse, si nous devons couvrir les manifestations et actions organisées par des groupes activistes et des ONG. Je me pose la question de savoir si relater les actions de ces groupes ne relève pas de la propagande. Dans ce cas il m’a paru évident que cet événement était à couvrir.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Le groupe Femen a pris contact avec les journalistes la veille de la conférence organisée par l’Université Libre de Bruxelles ULB sur le thème « délit de blasphème et la liberté d'expression »  qui était prevue  pour le 23 avril 2013. L'archevêque de Malines -Bruxelles et Primat de Belgique André- Joseph Léonard était invité à prendre la parole lors de cette conférence  et les membres du groupe de féministes Femen avaient prévu  de manifester lors de son discours . Les Femen ont manifesté contre ce qu’elles appellent  de l’homophobie de la part de l'église catholique à l'égard de la communauté gay. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Évidemment, l'archevêque Léonard n'était pas au courant de cette action et a même été surpris de voir un tas de photographes présents dans la salle. Je n'avais aucune idée de ce qui était prévu et je n'ai pas remarqué de personnes suspectes parmi  l'assemblée. Lorsque Mr Leonard a commencé son discours, quatre filles sont descendues des gradins et ont encerclé le prêtre. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Les Femen ont pulvérisé de l’eau à l’aide de bouteilles en forme de la sainte Vierge et ont crié des slogans contre l'homophobie. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Il a fallu quelques secondes avant que les militants soient  expulsés de la salle par des personnes assistant à la conférence. Mr Leonard est resté assis et a commencé à prier. Il n'a pas réagi et a attendu pacifiquement. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Certaines personnes dans la salle ont réagi très brutalement contre les activistes , mais aussi contre les photographes de presse . Nous avons été accusés par certains de complicité avec le groupe Femen . Ce qui es bien sûr absolument faux. Nous n'étions pas au courant de ce qui était sur le point d' avoir lieu . Notre tâche était d'être là et de faire notre travail.”"}

Ten minutes later, a man voiced a strong command in Balinese, “Inggih rarisan”. The ritual had started. Upon hearing the official command, numerous bare-chested youths clad in checked udeng (traditional headgear) and sarongs rushed and kicked the piles of burning coconut husks to mark the start of the &quot;Perang Api&quot; tradition, the battle of fire. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I predicted this moment would happen when my eyes saw a number of men run toward the piles of burning coconut husks. I felt fortunate because I was in a good position to be able to photograph the man kicking the burning husks. Fire flew in all directions.

Saya telah memprediksi bahwa moment ini akan terjadi saat mata saya melihat sejumlah pria berlari dari ke arah timur menuju tumpukan api dari serabut kelapa. Saya merasa beruntung karena saya dalam posisi yang tepat ketika saya memotret pria yang menendang api dari sabut kelapa. Saya berdiri di depannya. Sabut kelapa yang terbakar berterbangan. Secara tidak sadar kamera saya dan tangan kanan saya terluka oleh api. Pada waktu itu saya tidak merasa sakit, tapi hood lensa saya terbakar.”"}

The authorities and all the different police branches had already secured the area and it was tense, they didn’t let me pass and kept on saying “This is not a safe place for you”.  They repeated it several times and yes, it was not a safe place to be but I wanted everybody to see what was happening. So I went to the opposite side to where the bodies were hanging, always attentive to who could be observing me. I could see the bodies better.

Estaba de turno de noche cuando en la madrugada del 8 de marzo del 2013, llegó un reporte de unas personas colgadas en un puente. Agarre mi equipo y cerca de las 6 de la mañana yo ya estaba en el paso a desnivel. Eran cinco personas colgadas, completamente vendadas, habían sido ejecutados. Las autoridades y la policía habían llegado y el ambiente estaba tenso, me impidieron el paso y me decían &quot;No es un área segura para ti&quot;. Lo repetían en varias ocasiones, y si, era cierto, no era seguro estar ahí, pero era un hecho que se tenía que dar a conocer. Así que me cambie al otro lado, siempre atento de quien me pudiera estar observando, y pude ver los cuerpos mas de frente. Uno a uno los cuerpos fueron bajados y retirados del lugar. Tome las fotos y cuando termine para entonces ya había amanecido y decidi irme. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Aunque ya estoy acostumbrado a las escenas de crimen, siempre me vuelve a sorprender, este fue un sangriento amanecer.” "}

I took dozens of pictures of the kids jumping across the concrete arches from many different angles. When I went back to where I was staying to look over the images, I chose this one because I like the main boy’s fluid body motion and the other boys at the top who look at each other as if to say: “I dare you to jump next.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; At the time, French and Malian soldiers had recently taken the city from nine months of harsh jihadist rule.

J’ai pris plusieurs dizaines de photos d’eux sous divers angles parce que cette scène me semblait fascinante. A mon retour en éditant mes photos, j’ai choisi celle-ci pour transmettre parce que j’aime beaucoup le mouvement fluide du saut de l’enfant avec le regarde des autres qui semblent se mettre au défi de l’imiter.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; À l’époque, des soldats français et maliens avaient pris le contrôle de la ville de Gao des mains des djihadistes.

Upon the eventual re-election of President Barack Obama, those vibrations had turned into a sound too loud for me to ignore and I knew this was a story I needed to cover.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; After weeks of contacting militia leaders though back channels and message boards, I landed a face-to-face meeting with Jim Foster, the leader of the North Florida Survival Group, who after feeling out my intentions, granted me access to photograph one of their upcoming training missions in a secluded and secret area of the North Florida wilderness.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I showed up on the day of the training mission expecting to find an adversarial group weary of a journalist with a camera. Instead what I found were families; friendly people who were open and inviting to me – a stranger there trying to tell their story. Yes, their anti-government positions were clear but they made no attempt to proselytize or to interrogate me for my beliefs or opinions. They allowed me complete access to photograph anything I could see, including their training of children, some of whom carried AK-47 rifles, as they practiced enemy contact drills in preparation for a fight with the government that they appeared to honestly believe was both real and imminent.&quot; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Nikon D700, lens 28mm, f8, 1/200, ISO 800 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Members of the North Florida Survival Group wait with their rifles before heading out to perform enemy contact drills during a field training exercise in Old Town, Florida, December 8, 2012.

As I arrived the story was no different from hundreds of demonstrations I have covered as a photojournalist over many years. A group of enviromental activists were occupying Taksim's Gezi Park in order to thwart a reconstruction plan as part of which dozens of trees were being uprooted.  Riot police equipped with pepper spray launchers and smoke grenades asked them to leave. They resisted. I photographed as a policeman sprayed a burst of pepper gas at a protester; a woman standing in front of him in a red dress, carrying a handbag and nothing else. As the peaceful park protests evolved into full-scale countrywide violent clashes in which seven people lost their lives, my picture, &quot;the woman in red&quot; became one of the iconic images of the conflict.

Barışçıl park protestoları kısa sürede yurt geneline yayılıp yedi kişinin hayatını kaybettiği çatışmalara dönüşürken, &quot;kırmızılı kadın&quot; fotoğrafı  protestoların sembollerinden birisi haline gelmişti.

I knew the area, so I arrived quickly to where the most serious train accident in 40 years had just taken place. Arriving I saw total chaos: a high-speed train had been converted into a twisted mass of iron. I saw that other photographers were taking close-up pictures of the victims, so I decided to look for a different view. I searched for an elevated position to take an overall picture of the whole tragedy. It was at this point that something caught my eye – a wounded man was being held by a police officer and guided to a different place from where other victims were being sent. When I took the photo I thought he was a survivor who was talking on his cell phone to, I guessed, his family members to let them know he had survived the accident. It was only later, when I was editing the pictures that a fellow journalist realized that the man was José Garzón, the conductor, who allegedly caused the train accident by driving through a curve limited to 90km/h at an estimated speed of 190km/h.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS -1D Mark II N, lens 70-200mm at 200mm, f2.8, 1/100, ISO 800 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: An injured man, identified by Spanish newspapers El Pais and El Mundo as the train driver Francisco Jose Garzon, is helped by a policeman after a train crashed near Santiago de Compostela, northwestern Spain, July 24, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Esa tarde noche estaba preparando mi equipo para salir a tomar fotos de las fiestas locales, pero justo antes salir recibí una llamada informándome de que un accidente ferroviario sucediera a la entrada de la ciudad. Conozco bien la zona, por lo que llegué muy rápido al lugar del accidente ferroviario mas grave en 40 años. Al llegar veo mucho caos, un tren de alta velocidad convertido en un amasijo de hierros. Veo que hay otros compañeros tomando fotos muy cerca de las víctimas, por lo que decido tomar otro punto de vista distinto y me alejo lo más posible buscando una posición elevada para tomar una imagen global de toda la tragedia. Es en ese momento cuando me llama la atención un herido que sale agarrado por un agente de policía por un lugar distinto a donde estaban siendo evacuados el resto de los heridos, en el momento disparé por que me pareció una foto amable de un superviviente que además hablaba por su teléfono móvil para avisar (supongo) a los suyos de que sobreviviera al accidente. Es mas tarde, cuando estoy editando las imágenes, que un compañero periodista se da cuenta de que aquel hombre era José Garzón, el maquinista, quien presuntamente causara el accidente ferroviario al circular por una curva limitada a 90Km/h a una velocidad estimada de 190Km/h.”"}

Syrians use the town to enter Turkey from the Turkish Cilvegozu border gate, located opposite the Syrian commercial crossing point Bab al-Hawa which is just a few miles from Reyhanli. I have been there several times since the start of Syria's civil war to work on various stories about Syrian refugees. In the early afternoon of May 11, twin car bombs ripped into the crowded streets near Reyhanli's shopping district, scattering concrete blocks and smashing cars. Some 51 people were killed and dozens injured. I was in Ankara when the bombings occurred and flew to Hatay immediately. This picture was taken two days after the bombings.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Search and rescue teams were still on scene and there were still bodies being found under collapsed buildings. I decided to take a picture which would capture the size of the damage. I found a building which was also heavily damaged and deserted on the opposite side of the street. I climbed the stairs and found a spot on the roof that would be a good vantage point for pictures. The building in this picture was nextdoor to another which totally collapsed when one of the cars exploded in front of it. When the neighboring building collapsed it took the side walls of this building with it. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Suddenly, a man appeared in one of the apartments of the damaged building. He stood there for a minute and disapeared just as quickly as he had come. I don't know who he is. But this is why I like news photography.

We don't know his name or his age but we know that he is a victim; victim of war, victim of violence, victim of terrorism. The apartment may be his or maybe it is one of his friend's. He may live in Reyhanli, or he may not. Who knows? He may have lost a loved one during the blast. Even though we cannot answer these questions we can read a message by reading the picture in the right way: every day we, the people of this world, create new victims in different parts of the world just because of not understanding each other, not being respectful to people different than us...” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS -1D Mark 4, lens 70-200mm, f6.3, 1/640, ISO 400 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A man checks an apartment on a damaged building at the site of a blast in the town of Reyhanli in Hatay province, near the Turkish-Syrian border, May 13, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Reyhanlı, Hatay ili sınırları içerisinde bir sınır kasabası. Suriyeli mültecilerin Türkiye'ye giriş yaptığı önemli ve en yoğun geçiş noktalarından biri olan Cilvegözü Sınır Kapısı, sınırın öte yanındaki adıyla Bab al-Hawa,  Reyhanlı'nın hemen yanıbaşında. Suriye'deki iç savaşın alevlendiği günden bu yana Suriyeli mültecilere dair haberler yapmak üzere defalarca bölgeye seyahat edip bu coğrafyada oldukça fazla zaman geçirdim. 11 Mayıs 2013 Cumartesi günü öğle saatlerinde Reyhanlı'nın en işlek iki noktasında iki bomba yüklü araç infilak etti. Şiddetli patlamalar 51 kişinin ölümüne, onlarca insanın yaralanmasına , arabaların parçalanıp hurdaya dönmesine ve binaların yerlebir olmasına neden oldu. Patlamalar yaşandığında Ankara'daydım. Haberi alır almaz Hatay'a uçtum. Bölgeye vardığım geceden itibaren olay yerinden o gün ve takip eden günlerde çok sayıda  fotoğraf çektim. Baktığınız bu fotoğraf da onlardan biri. Patlamadan iki gün sonra yani 13 Kasım Pazartesi günü çekildi. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; O gün arama-kurtarma ekipleri hala olay yerindeki çalışmalarını sürdürüyor, yıkıntıların arasında insan cesetleri buluyorlardı. Son duruma ve olay yerindeki yıkımın boyutuna dair fikir verecek bir fotoğraf çekmeye karar verdim. Patlamalardan birinin gerçekleştiği caddenin hemen karşı tarafında, kendisi de patlamada ağır hasar görmüş ve terkedilmiş halde  bulunan bir binaya girdim. Uygun bir açı bulmak için merdivenleri tırmanıp çatıya kadar çıktım. Bulunduğum yerden fotoğrafladığım bu apartman, bombalardan biri hemen önünde patladığı için tamamen yıkılan bir binanın bitişiğinde. Komşu bina çöktüğünde onun da yan duvarlarını beraberinde alıp götürmüş. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Birden hasarlı binanın artık duvarsız dairelerinden birinde bir adam belirdi. Bir dakika kadar dairenin içine göz gezdirip sonra geldiği gibi aniden yok olup gitti. Adamın kim olduğunu öğrenemedim. Ama haber fotoğrafçılığını sevmemin asıl nedeni tam da burada gizli: Elinizde yeterli bilgi olmasa dahi bir öyküyü bir fotoğrafla olabildiğince etkileyici şekilde anlatmanızın mümkün olması!  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Adamın adını, yaşını bilmiyoruz. Tek bildiğimiz onun bir kurban olduğu. Savaşın, şiddetin, terörizmin kurbanı... Belki o apartman kendisinin ya da bir arkadaşına ait. Belki Reyhanlı'da yaşayan biri belki de değil. Kimbilir belki de patlamada sevdiği birini yitirdi. Bu sorulara yanıt vermesek de fotoğrafı doğru şekilde okuduğumuzda mesajı algılamamız mümkün: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Biz; bu dünya üzerinde yaşayan insanlar, hergün yeryüzünün farklı yerlerinde sadece birbirimizi anlamadığımız, bizden farklı olanlara saygı duymadığımız için kendi kendimize yeni kurbanlar yaratıp duruyoruz!”"}

I had read about Werner Freund and his wolf sanctuary in a guidebook about Germany's western province of Saarland. I desperately wanted snow for this story, so I waited for the right time. Finally, in January, I traveled to the little town of Merzig not far from the French border. In the beginning, I was not sure what to expect and if my hopes for a good story would be fulfilled. Initially, I was disappointed that it was not possible to shoot from inside the enclosure or to put a remote camera into it. When Werner entered the enclosure my doubts quickly faded. Surprisingly, he laid down and bit into the deer’s leg. He was the alphamale so he ate as the first ‘wolf’. To me, the moment shows not only a predator coming slowly closer to the prey but it is much more an expression of subordination and respect of a wolf towards the human Werner Freund.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 5D Mark III, lens 400mm, f2.8, 1/1250, ISO 320 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Wolf researcher Werner Freund bites into a deer cadaver next to a Mongolian wolf in an enclosure at Wolfspark Werner Freund, in Merzig in the German province of Saarland, January 24, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Schon bevor ich letzten Oktober nach Deutschland umzog, wusste ich, dass ich diese Story fotografieren wollte: Ich hatte von Werner Freund und seinem Wolfspark in einem Reiseführer über das Saarland im Westen Deutschlands gelesen. Weil ich unbedingt wollte, dass auf den Fotos Wölfe im Schnee zu sehen sind, musste ich auf die richtige Jahreszeit warten. Im Januar war es dann soweit: ich fuhr nach Merzig, eine kleine Stadt nicht weit von der französischen Grenze. Ich wusste nicht, was mich dort erwarten würde und ob sich meine Hoffnungen auf eine gute Geschichte erfüllen. Zunächst war ich enttäuscht, weil ich nicht innerhalb des Zauns fotografieren und dort auch keine Remote Kamera aufstellen konnte. Doch als Werner Freund das Gehege betrat waren meine Zweifel schnell verfolgen. Ich war überrascht, dass er sich wirklich auf den Boden legte und in das Bein des toten Rehs biss und gemäß eines Alphatiers als erster &quot;Wolf&quot; fraß. Für mich zeigt dieser Moment nicht nur ein Raubtier, das sich langsam der Beute nähert, sondern vielmehr einen Augenblick der Unterordnung und des Respekts, die der Wolf dem Mensch Werner Freund entgegenbringt.”"}

Usually that assignment is considered protective and doesn't promise a nice picture but this day was different. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; What caught my eye before the helicopter even landed to pick up the president was the fact every child in the guest viewing area seemed to be wearing similar red sweaters with the same crest identifying them as a special group.

It was, and my search discovered they were from Florida. So I called the school to verify if their students were in Washington, DC. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I knew once the helicopter started its powerful liftoff from the lawn, a huge blast of wind would blow right through the kids and I knew from experience they would react with enthusiasm. Marine One is loud and very windy. Hats and umbrellas don't stand a chance once this helicopter revs up its engine. What I got was a uniform and spontaneous reaction from both the kids, and their hair, which gave the picture its life. The back lighting gave all the hair the same spun-glass look to it. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The guest area is about 75 feet from the press viewing area and I used a longer telephoto lens to reach across to capture the picture.

When I arrived at the makeshift morgue, I saw people looking at the dead bodies. They could not believe what had happened during the night. They were looking for their relatives between scores of dead bodies that had arrived in Duma city, from Zamalka and Ein Tarma, in a desperate attempt to provide treatment to them before they died. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This man held an infant baby girl. She did not look dead. She looked as though she had fallen into a deep sleep. He raised her body and checked if she was really dead.

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;CARLOS BARRIA&lt;/b&gt;, Mongolia &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “I learned about this group a year ago when I read an article in the local media. I started to research a bit and I found just one article in the foreign press, from 2010. I got in contact with a fixer in Ulan Bator who works for a human rights group and she helped me to get in touch with the ultra-nationalists. I asked for permission to photograph them, although at that moment I didn't know they were turning to environmental issues. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; A couple of weeks prior to my trip to Mongolia, the fixer I was working with told me that the leader of the group was no longer prioritizing attacks on women suspected of being prostitutes, and that they wanted to focus on environmental issues. That was a very interesting twist in the story. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I went to Mongolia for 10 days to cover the presidential elections and other stories. I met with the Tsagaan Khass four times. During the first interview, I was a little tense. I wanted to make sure there wouldn't be any misunderstandings about the project or any negative consequences for the fixer and translator helping me, since they live in Mongolia. After that I went alone. Some members of the group were quite relaxed but at the same time they were always very secretive about where we were going. That part was a little tense for me. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Things turned a little strange when they introduced me to members of the Khukh Mongol (Blue Mongolia) at the gym. I was asking if it would be possible for me to join one of their ‘environmental patrols’ when someone asked me if I had seen dead bodies before. I answered: “Yes, many times.” Then the same man asked me through a translator (one of the members of the Tsagaan Khass) if I would like to see how they &quot;kill some Chinese people.&quot; He made a gesture of cutting his throat with a knife. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I told him I would go where they go, but under no circumstance would I photograph acts of violence. I told them: &quot;I will walk away.” I didn't want them to attack someone because they had a photographer with them, and I didn't want to be used by them to show violence. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; They laughed at me, and in the end there was no violence. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The experience was intense. I was thinking all the time about how they see themselves. I was not surprised to see a lot of young members. When you take into account that Mongolia has 30 percent unemployment, despite a mining boom, it seemed likely that some young people might turn to groups like this one looking for answers. I asked two teenagers why they were part of this group, and they told me because they wanted to help people. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I think the challenging part was trying to be as open as possible to understand their position, to understand why they do what they do. It's easy to see them in a negative light, based on their actions, with which I don't agree. But as a journalist, the most challenging part was trying to go deeper, and at the same time to see the wider picture of what is going on in Mongolia society today. I’m still trying to do that. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I took this picture during a walk around a construction site; they wanted to show me a place where undocumented immigrants work.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 5D Mark III, lens 16-35mm at 16mm, f2.8, 1/1600, ISO 250 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Ariunbold and Uranjargal (L), leaders of the Mongolian neo-Nazi group Tsagaan Khass, stand next to a construction site in Ulan Bator June 22, 2013. The group has rebranded itself as an environmentalist organisation fighting pollution by foreign-owned mines, seeking legitimacy as it sends Swastika-wearing members to check mining permits. Over the past years, ultra-nationalist groups have expanded in the country and among those garnering attention is Tsagaan Khass, which has recently shifted its focus from activities such as attacks on women it accuses of consorting with foreign men to environmental issues, with the stated goal of protecting Mongolia from foreign mining interests. This ultra-nationalist group was founded in the 1990s and currently has 100-plus members. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Би энэ бүлгийн тухай орон нутгийн сониноос нийтлэл уншсанаар мэдэж авсан юм. Цааш дэлгэрүүлэн судлахыг оролдсон ч 2010 онд гадаадын хэвлэлд бичсэн нийтлэл л лосон. Харин дараа нь Улаанбаатарт хүний эрхийн байгууллагад ажилладаг эмэгтэйтэй холбогдсоноор хэт үндсэрхэг үзэлтнүүдтэй холбогдох боломжтой болсон. Мөн тухайн үед тэднийг хүрээлэн буй орчны талаар анхаарлаа хандуулж байгааг мэдээгүй ч, найзаараа тэдний тухай гэрэл зургийн сурвалжлага хийж болох эсэхийг асуулгасан.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Монголд хоёр долоо хоног болоход хамт ажилласан хүн маань тэднийг биеэ үнэлэгч эмэгтэйчүүдээс илүү хүрээлэн буй орчны талаар анхаарлаа хандуулах болсныг дуулгасан юм. Энэ нь нийтлэлийг минь харин ч маш сонирхолтой болгох юм шиг санагдсан.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Би Монгол руу Ерөнхийлөгчийн сонгууль болон өөр хэд хэдэн асуудлын талаар сурвалжлага бэлтгэхээр 10 хоногийн хугацаатай очсон. Тэр үед “Цагаан хас” бүлгэмийнхэнтэй дөрвөн удаа уулзсан юм. Миний хувьд, тэднийг сурвалжлагын талаар маань буруу ойлгох вий, нөгөөтэйгүүр тэд Монголд амьдардаг тул тусалж байсан хүн болон орчуулагчид минь муу зүйл тохиохгүй байгаа гэж санаа зовж байлаа. Тиймээс дараа нь ганцаараа явсан юм. Бүлгэмийн залуус маш тайван байсан ч хаа нэг тийш явахдаа маш нууцлаг байдал үзүүлж байсан нь надад эвгүй санагдаж байв.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Ялангуяа, тэд “Хөх Монгол” бүлгэмийн гишүүдийг нэгэн спорт клубт танилцуулсан нь их сонин санагдсан. Намайг байгаль орчны эргүүлтэй уулзаж болох эсэхийг асуухад тэд надаас урьд нь үхсэн хүн харж байсан талаар асуусан юм. Би “Тийм ээ, олон удаа” гэхэд тэр залуу (“Цагаан хас” бүлгэмийн гишүүн) орчуулагчаар дамжуулан “Хятад хүн хэрхэн алдгийг хармаар байна уу” гэж асуулгав. Тэгээд хутгаар хоолой хэрчиж байгаа мэт дүрслэл үзүүлсэн.Тэдэнтэй цааш хамт явахыг хүсэхэд хүчирхийллийн аливаа үзэгдлийн зургийг авч болохгүй гэсэн нөхцөлтэйгээр зөвшөөрсөн юм. Харин “Би тэгвэл явахгүй” гэж хэлсэн. Би тэднийг гэрэл зурагчинтай яваа учраас хэн нэгэнд халдах, хэн нэгэнд хүчирхийлэл үйлдэхдээ намайг ашиглаасай гэж хүсээгүй.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Харин тэд над руу инээгээд, эцэст нь мэдээж тэнд ямар нэг хүчирхийлэл байгаагүй. Надад дээрх тохиолдлууд их хүчтэй нөлөөлсөн. Тэд өөрсдийгөө юу гэж боддог, хэрхэн хардаг талаар би маш удаан бодсон. Тэнд олон залуу гишүүдийг хараад би тийм ч гайхаагүй. Хэдийгээр уул уурхайн огцом тэсрэлт болж байгаа ч, хүн амын 30% нь ажилгүй байгаа нийгмийн хувьд залуус ийнхүү бүлэглэж асуултын хариу хайх нь аргагүй мэт. Тэдгээр залуугаас яагаад энэ бүлгэмд байгааг сонирхоход хүмүүст туслахыг хүссэн гэж хариулж байлаа.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Хамгийн хэцүү нь тэдний үзэл бодол, яагаад ийм зүйл хийж байгаа зэргийг ойлгох, нээлттэйгээр хандах нь нэг төрлийн сорилт байлаа. Мэдээж тэдний үйлдлийг хараад санал нийлэхгүй зүйлсээрээ далайлган шууд эсрэг талаас нь харах амархан л даа. Гэхдээ сэтгүүлчийн хувьд илүү гүн рүү нь орохын зэрэгцээ Монголын өнөөгийн нийгэмд болж буй зүйлсийг өргөн хүрээгээр авч үзэх нь чухал юм. Би одоог хүртэл ингэхийг л оролдож байна.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Дараах зургуудийг бид барилгын барилгын ажил явагдаж буй газруудаар явахад авсан юм. Тэд хэлэхдээ бичиг, баримтгүй гадаадын иргэд тийнхүү ажилладаг гээд намайг авч очсон.”"}

He was there mourning the loss of his father, who also shared his name.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Ronnie Chambers was shot in the head on January 26. His mother Shirley Chambers has lost all four of her children to gun violence. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Seeing Ronnie Jr. caused me to choke up a little, thinking about the parallels between his life and mine. Seeing him move about the church, seemingly unaware of the gravity of the situation, explained to me in that moment why all I can recall about my father’s funeral was sitting in my uncle’s lap during the service, and a photo of my father in his casket that my mother used to keep in the glove box of her car.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; For me, as significant as that day was, to a child it wasn’t much different than many other church experiences we have while navigating through the adult world. The situation was already emotional for me having met Ms. Chambers last week during an interview. Looking her in the eye and saying my goodbyes, I was left speechless, knowing there was nothing I could do to comfort her in her bereavement, other than a long look of solace and my silence.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 5D Mark III, lens 70-200mm at 175mm, f2.8, 1/100, ISO 2500  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  Caption: Ronnie Chambers Jr. looks at his mother Tahitah Myles (obscured) as she collapses during the funeral for his father Ronnie Chambers, 33, a victim of gun violence, in Chicago February 4, 2013."}

It’s called the “Photo Room” and at the Academy Awards it’s where the winners come, sometimes directly after they win, but most times in a frenzied swarm of famous faces and designer fashion at the conclusion of the show. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Sixty or so of us sit facing a 50-foot-wide golden draped backdrop with a raised stage about 25 feet away. There are three larger-than-human gold painted Oscar statues placed at either end with one in the center. The idea is that the newly announced Oscar winner is brought up from behind the stage at one end and then will pose for the 60 or so photographers, from three set positions along the stage. It is an extremely efficient system, although somewhat lacking in originality and creativity, considering the industry putting on the show. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; While accepting her best actress award for “Silver Linnings Playbook” at the 85th Academy Awards, Jennifer Lawrence had a little difficulty making it up on stage in front of pretty much the whole world. So when she turned the corner into the photo room to step up onto our little stage, one of the continually yapping photographers yelled out “Watch Your Step”. Jennifer’s timing was swift and direct and she delivered what I thought was a perfect reaction to a snide remark. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; My camera can shoot 10 frames a second, and my finger went down, I was shooting available light because we are no longer allowed to light the room with our lighting kits.

After calling me many times before and nothing happening when I arrived, I regarded this latest information suspiciously. After some time I decided to go and check it out. I found a group of Orthodox Jews challenging security forces around the construction site where they believed there were graves belonging to Jews. Things started to get violent. When they protest, the Orthodox Jews are very direct and seem not to be afraid to challenge the police. I felt that the special element of this protest was that the demonstrators were so determined to deliver their message that they wouldn’t give up.The police, who are generally very experienced in dealing with protests, react quickly and aggressively. However, the police were not very experienced with these types of protesters which made them lose their temper at some point and go as far as to drag some of them across the protest lines. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In my head, the immediate association visually, for an ultra-Orthodox Jew to be dragged like that in the street was very strong and as much as I could understand both sides of the protest, seeing this visual had a very dramatic association in Israel with regards to the Jewish history.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon 5D Mark III, lens 24 mm, f5.5, 1/1000, ISO 100 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: An Israeli policeman drags an ultra-Orthodox man during clashes in the town of Beit Shemesh, near Jerusalem August 12, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; בבוקר היום של האירוע בצילום קיבלתי שיחת טלפון מאיש קשר שמודיע לי על אירועים בקהילה החרדית והוא מסר לי שיש הפגנה מתוכננת איפה שהוא באיזור בית שמש בהמשך היום. כיוון שבהרבה מקרים קודמים &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; המידע שקיבלתי ממנו היה מוגזם ביחס לגודל האירוע ולרצינות שלו התיחסתי גם לאירוע הזה באותו אופן אך בכל זאת החלטתי לנסוע לראות מה קורה בשטח. כשהגעתי ראיתי קבוצה לא מאוד גדולה של חרדים &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;מאתגרים את חברת השמירה שהוצבה במקום ואיתה היה כבר כוח משטרה. המפגינים טענו, באופן כללי, שיש במקום קברים של יהודים ולכן עבודות הפיתוח של האיזור חייבות להיפסק. החרדים, ככלל, בהפגנות שלהם  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; ובעיקר בעניינים כאלו,  מאוד נחושים ופשוט לא מוותרים. נראה כאילו הם פשוט חסרי כל פחד מהשוטרים ומאנשי האבטחה וגם כשממש גוררים אותם מהמקום- הם חוזרים ומאתגרים את השוטרים שוב ושוב.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; נראה כוחות היס&quot;מ שמאוד מנוסים בפיזור הפגנות לא ממש מתרגשים מעוצמת ההתנגדות אבל בהחלט לא יודעים איך להתיחס לסוג כזה של מפגינים שפשוט לא מוותרים ולא נראה שאכפת להם לחטוף מכות, זרנוקי &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; מים, גרירות על הרצפה או כל דבר אחר.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;בעיני, האסוציציה הויזואלית המיידית של איש חרדי נגרר בצורה כזאת על הרצפה קשה מאוד וכמה שאני יכול להבין את שני הצדדים מאירוע מהסוג הזה- הדימוי הזה, בהקשר ההיסטורי היהודי- קשה לצפיה ודרמתי  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; ביותר עבורי&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; "}

I went to take pictures of the weapons factory where I found Issa working with his father for the whole day. At night, Issa would go home, feed his bird, take a shower and have dinner with his family, during regular power cuts. He then would go to bed only to wake up early in the morning to go back again to carry weapons and do his tasks at the factory.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 5D Mark II, lens 70-300mm at 75mm, f4.5, 1/50, ISO 1600 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Issa, 10 years old, carries a mortar shell in a weapons factory of the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo, September 7, 2013.

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;IVAN ALVARADO&lt;/b&gt;, Chile &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “To take this photograph I had to consider a whole realm of technical elements other than just camera settings. I had to take into account the weather, the characteristics of the plane, the best altitude to fly, the time of day, the height of the clouds, and of course the permission from the lithium plant owner. At one of the plants that I requested access to, the person on the other end of the phone denied me, in a serious voice: “It’s an industrial secret.” Renting a plane to take photos is not cheap, so I had to minimize the possibility of mistakes so the flight was as productive as possible.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; From the ground, lithium plants don’t look different from many other industrial operations in remote regions. But the singular aspect of these is that in the middle of the Atacama Desert, they have enormous, colorful pools that are used in the process of extracting lithium, and these pools are best appreciated from above. When planning this story with my editor, we spoke of what characteristics the plane must have to produce a “clean” image, such as retractable landing gear and wings above the fuselage. After searching a few days, I found one air park that had a Cessna 210M with those features plus a large window. If weather permitted, it would be perfect for this photo. The day of the picture, I checked the sky at dawn to see if it was as the weather report had predicted, and it was. There were very high clouds that served as a filter to soften the morning light. The lithium pools continue there, and they will constantly be modified as the demand for lithium transforms the unusual landscape.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS 1DX, lens 16mm, f5.6, 1/2700, ISO 100 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: An aerial view of the brine pools and processing areas of the Rockwood lithium plant on the Atacama salt flat, the largest lithium deposit currently in production, in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, January 10, 2013. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2013/04/05/the-lithium-triangle/&quot;&gt;Click here for a related blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “Para tomar esta fotografía tenía que considerar una serie de elementos técnicos que no fueron sólo ajustes de la cámara. Tomé en cuenta el clima, las características del avión, la mejor altura de vuelo, la hora del día, la altura de las nubes, y por supuesto, el permiso del propietario de la planta de litio. En una de las plantas que solicitó el acceso, la persona que me atendió por teléfono me negó con voz seria: &quot;Es un secreto industrial. &quot; Alquilar un avión para tomar fotos no es barato, así que tuve que reducir al mínimo la posibilidad de errores para que el vuelo fuera lo más productivo posible. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Desde el suelo las plantas de litio no se ven diferentes de muchas otras operaciones industriales en regiones remotas. Pero el aspecto singular de estos es que en el medio del desierto de Atacama, tienen enormes piscinas coloridos que se utilizan en el proceso de extracción de litio. Estas piscinas se aprecian mejor desde arriba. Al organizar esta historia con mi editor, hablamos de cuales características el avión debe tener para producir una imagen &quot;limpia,&quot; como el tren de aterrizaje retráctil y alas sobre el fuselaje. Después de buscar un par de días encontré un aeroparques que tenía un Cessna 210M con esas características, además de una gran ventana. Si el tiempo lo permitía, iba a ser ideal para esta foto. El día de la foto miré el cielo al amanecer para ver si estaba como decía la predicción de tiempo, y así fue. Había nubes muy altas que sirvieron como filtro para suavizar la luz de la mañana. Las piscinas de litio siguen allí, mientras la demanda de litio continua transformando el paisaje inusual.”"}

"caption" : "&lt;b&gt;MOHAMMED SALEM&lt;/b&gt;, Gaza &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; “I got a phone call from a friend asking if I wanted to photograph a wedding in Gaza. I told him I wasn’t interested but when he told me the groom was 15 years old and the bride was one year younger than him, I rushed to the location immediately.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; After arriving I saw people celebrating in the street not far from the border between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip. Among them was a young Palestinian boy being carried on the shoulders of relatives and friends. I couldn’t believe that the boy was the groom until I asked him and he replied with a smile, “yes I am”. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; After he finished celebrating at a party held a day before the official wedding, he went to play with friends in the street where they enjoyed flavored frozen drinks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The second day I went back and continued covering the story, the official wedding was to take place that day. I was surprised when I saw the groom’s mother helping him put on his wedding suit. I couldn’t avoid thinking that it looked as if she was dressing him for school. After that he started combing his hair using a broken piece of a mirror. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I realized how poor the family was when I noticed that he and his wife share the three-room house with the rest of the family – another nine people.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I asked the young groom if I could go with him into the house where the bride was getting prepared. When we entered the house, which was only nextdoor, I realized that the family had not yet repaired the damage that was caused from an Israeli strike in 2009. When young Soboh looked at his bride and saw she was veiled, his face became frank and serious. At that moment the bride spoke to her groom and said, “let’s smile and have our photo taken”. One thing she forgot to do before posing for the photograph was to remove her veil.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS-1D X, lens 35mm, f1.4, 1/125 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: Young Palestinian groom Ahmed Soboh, 15 and his bride Tala, 14, stand inside Tala's house which was damaged during an Israeli strike in 2009, during their wedding party in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border between Israeli and northern Gaza Strip September 24, 2013.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;تلقيت مكالمة هاتفية من صديق يسألني اذا ما أردت أن أقوم بتصوير حفل زواج في قطاع غزة. أخبرته أن ليس لدي  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; رغبة في ذلك ولكن حينما أخبرني أن العريس يبلغ من العمر 15 عاما وأن العروس أصغر منه بعام واحد، توجهت &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; نحو المكان حالا&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; فور وصولي للمكان وجدت الناس يحتفلون في الشارع ولم يكن ذلك بعيدا عن منطقة الحدود ما بين شمال قطاع غزة &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; واسرائيل. ومن بين هؤلاء الناس كان هناك ولد فلسطيني صغير محمولا على أكتاف أصدقائه وأقاربه. لم أصدق أن &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; هذا الولد هو العريس نفسه حتى سألته وأجابني مضحكا &quot;نعم أنا.&quot; وبعد ما انتهى الاحتفال في حفلته التي حدثت قبل &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;يوم من حفل الزواج الرسمي، ذهب مع أصدقائه في الشارع ليستمتعوا هناك بالمشروب المثلج &quot;البراد&quot;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;في اليوم الثاني عدت مرة أخرى للمكان وواصلت تغطية القصة وذلك تزامنا مع يوم الحفل الرسمي. لقد كنت مندهشا  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; حينما رأيت والدة العريس وهي تساعده على ارتداء بدلة الفرح. لم أستطع التوقف عن التصور كما لو أنه امه كانت &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; تساعده لارتداء ملابس المدرسة. وبعد ذلك بدأ بتمشيط شعره مستخدما قطعة مكسورة من مرآة. لقد أدركت مدى فقر &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;العائلة عندما لاحظت أن العريس وزوجته يسكنون مع 9 اخرين من أفراد عائلته في نفس البيت المكون من ثلاث  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;غرف. سألت العريس الصغير اذا ما كان هناك امكانية للذهاب معه الى البيت الذي كانت تتجهز العروس فيه. وعندما  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; دخلت البيت والذي كان مجاور لباب بيت العريس أدركت أن العائلة لم تصلح بعد الضرر الذي لحق بالبيت جراء &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;قصف اسرائيلي عام 2009. وحينما نظر الصغير صبح الى زوجته وهي تغطي وجهها أصبح وجهه أكثر جدية. في  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;تلك اللحظات تحدثت العروس مع العريس قائلة:&quot;دعنا نضحك لنتصور.&quot; لقد نسيت أن تفعل شيئا واحد قبل التصوير  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;.وهو ازاله الغطاء عن وجهها &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;"}

A large number of journalists on-site were there to observe the destruction in the city but no bodies of rebels had been left visible by the time the press arrived. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; While isolated from the main media group and walking down a dirt road, a civilian resident approached me and said that a rebel soldier had been burned in a house. I asked him if he would discreetly show me where this was and he led me to the house, luckily without drawing the attention of my media colleagues. Arriving in front of a small house made of mud, the man showed me the way in, and then disappeared.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; It was very dark as I stepped inside and I was immediately hit with a sickening stench. I quickly discovered the remains of a burned body – that of an Islamist rebel –  according to the locals. The detail that stuck in my mind was the almost-perfect alignment of his shoes.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; I will never know if he died before or after being set on fire.”  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Canon EOS5 Mark III, lens 16-35mm, f 3.5, 1/10, ISO 800 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Caption: A charred body believed to be an Islamist rebel burnt by inhabitants of Konna, according to local residents, is seen in the recently liberated town of Konna January 27, 2013.

Arrive devant une maison en terre, l'homme me montra l'entree et disparut. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; A l'nterieur il faisait tres sombre et j'etais presque dans l'obscurite. Sans grande visibilite, je me suis dirige &quot;a l'odeur&quot; et ai finalement decouvert le corps calcine, suppose (selon les habitants) etre celui d'un rebelle islamiste. Le detail qui m'interpelle encore, reste l'allignenement presque parfait de ses chaussures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Je n'ai jamais pu verifier ni savoir s'il etait mort avant ou apres avoir ete brule.&quot;"}
